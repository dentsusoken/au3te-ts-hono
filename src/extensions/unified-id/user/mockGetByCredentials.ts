/**
 * Implements a mock user authentication service.
 * Performs a simple credential verification against a static user repository.
 * This implementation is intended for testing and development purposes only.
 *
 * @implements {GetByCredentials}
 * @param loginId - Unique identifier for user authentication (typically username or email)
 * @param password - User's authentication credential
 * @returns {Promise<User | undefined>} Returns a Promise that resolves to:
 *                                     - User object if credentials match
 *                                     - undefined if no matching user is found
 * @example
 * const user = await mockGetByCredentials('inga', 'inga');
 * if (user) {
 *   console.log('Authentication successful:', user.name);
 * }
