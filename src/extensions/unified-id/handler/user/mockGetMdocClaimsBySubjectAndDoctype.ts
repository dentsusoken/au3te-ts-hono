/**
 * Implements a mock mobile document (mdoc) claims lookup service by subject and document type.
 * Performs a lookup against a static mdoc repository using the subject identifier and document type.
 * This implementation is intended for testing and development purposes only.
 *
 * @implements {GetMdocClaimsBySubjectAndDoctype}
 * @param subject - The unique subject identifier to search for
 * @param doctype - The document type identifier (e.g. 'org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL')
 * @returns {Promise<Mdoc | undefined>} Returns a Promise that resolves to:
 *                                     - Mdoc object if matching claims are found
 *                                     - undefined if no matching claims are found
 * @example
 * const mdoc = await mockGetMdocClaimsBySubjectAndDoctype('1004', 'org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL');
 * if (mdoc) {
 *   console.log('Mdoc claims found:', mdoc);
