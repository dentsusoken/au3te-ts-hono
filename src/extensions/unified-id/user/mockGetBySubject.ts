/**
 * Implements a mock user lookup service by subject identifier.
 * Performs a simple search against a static user repository using the subject identifier.
 * This implementation is intended for testing and development purposes only.
 *
 * @implements {GetBySubject}
 * @param subject - The unique subject identifier to search for
 * @returns {Promise<User | undefined>} Returns a Promise that resolves to:
 *                                     - User object if subject matches
 *                                     - undefined if no matching user is found
 * @example
 * const user = await mockGetBySubject('1004');
 * if (user) {
 *   console.log('User found:', user.name);
 * }
